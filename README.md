# Project Title ðŸš€

## Overview
Brief description of the project.  
Example: *This project applies machine learning to classify text data into categories using Python and scikit-learn. Built as part of my Human Language Technology coursework at CU Boulder.*

## Data
- Source of data (if open/public, include link; if not, describe type).  
- Preprocessing steps (cleaning, tokenization, feature extraction).  

## Methods
- Tools & Libraries: `Python`, `Pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `spaCy`, `NLTK`  
- Approach: e.g., trained supervised models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) for classification.  

## Results
- Key metrics (accuracy, F1 score, etc.).  
- Graphs/plots (add screenshots later).  

## How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cstenc/project-name.git
cd project-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
